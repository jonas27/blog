# This my new Blog.
Hey,

I am Jonas and currently studying computer science at the Technical University in Freiburg. 
My passion is backend coding and Kubernetes stuff, so basically the entire pipeline from start to finish of a service. 

My free time is dominated by sport, mostly triathlon, climbing and parkour. You can also play chess with me on[lichess](https://lichess.org/@/jonas27).
