# Optrodes and Optogenetics
This is going to be the last post about neurotechnology but just maybe the most interesting one as well. In Optogenetics light is used to either show which regions of the brain are excited or to stimluate/inhibit certain regions. To make cells light sensitive they need to contain a certain protein

#### Disclaimer:
This is just a summary of what I learned and I will try to be as accurate as possible.
But there are probably mistakes in the text!
