# Processing Techniques Deep Dive
This part is going to be a little nerdy, so if you don't want to read much technical blabla, click here to skip to the next part. With that out of the way, let's go deep.

The base materials used for neurotechnoogy are mostly the same as in standard electronics, mainly silicon, polysilicon, polymers and dialectrics. As the materials are not pure after extraction they often need purification and with todays technology, we can get close to 100% purity. The base material for computer chips is called the "substrate" and usually produced in wafers with a diameter of *<300mm* for CMOS and *4“, 6“, 8“*  for MEMS in neuroscience. These wafers are cut from single crystal ingots derived with the Czochralski process. Often, the same materials are used as in common electronics to achieve the same goal: tiny and highly customizable chips (ie. micrometers matter!). But there some materials used in neuroscience which are not commonly used elsewhere and I will come back to those in a little while. For the moment let's keep it simple. Below is an image of different wafer sizes.

It's important to understand that the substrate is (usually) out of one non-conductive material. The interesting things, electronic circuits and more, are "inserted" onto the wafer by using one of the following production techniques:
* Thin film deposition: The substrate is covered with a small film, eg. a mirror has a small metal coating/film on the backside of the class which makes it reflective. We differentiate between physical deposition and chemical depoistion. The former uses mechanical, electromechanical or thermodynamic means to produce a thin film of solid and a prime example of it is frost. In the latter, a fluid precursor undergoes a chemical change at a solid surface, leaving a solid layer.  Thin film coating is achieved with oxidation (eg. Silicon dioxide $SiO_2$), sputter deposition (relies on plasma or nitrogen/oxygen to knock of a few atmos of the substrate and is usefull when materials would evaporate at different rates). Various other techniques exist, but these are the two most important. 
* Spin coating: The coating material is put into the middle of the substrate. Then, the substrate is rotated and the coating material distributes itself evenly via centrifugal forces. 


* Patterning: We apply a masking layer to the substrate.

All techniques add an additional layer to the substrate. To get the wanted result we then need to remove the new material in places we don't want it. This is usually where the patterning comes in. Patterning exposes only certain areas and these can then be removed. To do this we use:



* Grinding: With We usually grind the substrate to make it smaller.
