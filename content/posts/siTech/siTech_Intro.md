# Silicon-based Neurotechnology
In recent years, advances in manufacturing, packaging technologies and software have made electrical probes both smaller and more capable, while also decreasing the production price. These advances enabled the development of Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) and their usage in humans. BCIs in themselves are not Neuroprosthetics, meaning they don't substitute a functional part of the body but rather act as so called "Mind-machine interface" (MMI) or "Brain-machine interface" (BMI).

A prime example for a BCI probe is the Utah Array, which will covered in the third part of this series. The Utah Array is a probe with 100x100 needles each needle having one recording site. In the image below it sits on top of a one penny coin and this thing is small!!!

These probes can us help gain a deeper understanding of the workings of the brain. But not only can we use them as sensors, but also as actuators, taking an active role in the brain. They also have the potential to help a lot of people with different cognitive diseases, examples include patients with paralysis, seizures and mental disorders. Isn't that cool?

But how does this actually work and what in the brain are we measuring or influencing. The human nervous system is probably the most complex system we have inside our body. It influences and regulates every part of the body and has two distinct parts, the Central Nervous System (CNS) or Peripheral Nervous System (PNS). The former includes the brain and the spinal cord, while the latter is the rest of our nervous system and is mostly controlled subconsciously. The nervous system mainly operates via electrical and chemical stimuli, but there is also another system, the endocrine system, which regulates our hormones via chemical messengers. In this series, I will concentrate on the CNS as it is where most research is going into. 

Let's take a fast tour of the makings of the brain. It weighs between 1 -- 3kg and is contained in fluid to prevent damage. It has two hemispheres each divided in 4 lobes and is wrapped in blood vessels. So despite weighing less 2% of our body mass the brain consumes a whopping 20% of our energy and oxygen! But even more astounding, is the fact that it is home to more than 100 billion neurons.

The interesting patt about neurons is their interconnectivity. One neuron has many incoming and outgoing "lines". The incoming lines are the connections over the so called dendrites. A neuron makes a decision based on the information it receives from all the incoming lines combined. The decision making process happens in the Nucleus and is then shared through the Axon (tale) with more neurons. So the firing of one neuron can possibly affect thousand and millions of over neurons. We differentiate between afferent (sensor) neurons, efferent (motor) neurons and interneurons (neurons for information transfer between the neurons).

With these new probes we can now detect which neurons are firing after a certain stimulus and as we will see later in this series, even control the neurons. It is an exciting field of research and it seems only the sky's the limit.

But this new technology comes with a price. There are multiple regulatory hurdles before a probe can be used in humans. In short, first the probe needs to be developed and tested. This is usually done in mice specifically bread to have a larger skull and broader nose, called yoda mice.

Afterwards, the probe must be tested in apes. If it is considered "save" enough and its advantages outweigh the downsides of implanting these probes (the skull must be cut open and the probe, although tiny, is stammped into the brain, wounding the tissue), it is admitted for human trial. The only probe ever being admitted for usage in humans is the Utah Array and only in patients with serious cognitive illnesses. And while this is spectacular, we often tend to forget that animals need to have suffered and where mistreated in the name of science.

I can't propose a good solution and I am not sure if I am favor of abolishing all work on animals. But, in my opinion we have to always ponder whether science outweighs morality and we definitely have to take the life of these animals serious. As my professor said during a lecture: "We have to remember, after usage we have to through these mice away". It sounds cold hearted but it's the reality.
