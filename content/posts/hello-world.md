<div style="text-align: justify">

This is the first post on my new site. I am hopeful that there is more stuff coming, so I will keep this brief and painless. <br />
I am going to write about anything that pops into my head, so anything from tech, vegan, health and me. But I will try to keep it techy. <br />
For those who care, this blog uses the [gohugo-framework](https://gohugo.io/) and the [MemE-theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-meme/). I wanted to build a website from scratch for quite some time, but never got more  than a few lines of react code. And react is quite frustrating to get started with, really, really frustrating. Having said that, I am working on a new React Native app and hopefully you can soon read more about it here. <br />
But before any of that, I have to pass my exams and I think I will also post more on that stuff here. It is going to be a lot of posting apparently. Anyway, I am going climbing now. :muscle:
